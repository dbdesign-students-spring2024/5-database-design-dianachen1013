# Data Normalization and Entity-Relationship Diagramming
An assignment to normalize the structure of data and establish a set of Entity-Relationship Diagrams for the data.   
## Original Form
The following table, representing students' grades in courses at a university, is already in [first normal form](/courses/database-design/normal-forms-simple-guide/#first-normal-form) (1NF) - all records have the same number of fields, and there is only one value per field.

| assignment_id | student_id | due_date | professor | assignment_topic                | classroom | grade | relevant_reading    | professor_email   |
| :------------ | :--------- | :------- | :-------- | :------------------------------ | :-------- | :---- | :------------------ | :---------------- |

## Why the Original Form is Not in 4NF:

The original form provided in the question is not in Fourth Normal Form (4NF) for several reasons related to the characteristics and requirements of 4NF, which specifically deals with the elimination of multi-valued dependencies in a database schema. To understand why the original form does not comply with 4NF, let's review what 4NF entails and apply it to the given data structure.   

### Fourth Normal Form (4NF) Requirements:

A table is in 4NF if it is in Third Normal Form (3NF) and does not have any multi-valued dependencies (MVDs). MVDs occur when for a single key, there are multiple independent values possible for other columns.
In simpler terms, a table violates 4NF if a table structure allows a scenario where one key relates to two or more independent sets of values, and those sets could be entered into the table as separate rows, leading to unnecessary duplication of data.  

### Why the original form doesn't satisfy a 4NF requirement: 

Multi-Valued Dependencies: The original table combines data that naturally forms multi-valued dependencies. For instance, a professor can give multiple assignments, and those assignments can be given to multiple students. These are two separate relationships but are combined into one table in the original form.  

Redundancy: The original table structure allows for redundancy. For example, professor and professor_email are repeated for each assignment given by the same professor. This repeats information unnecessarily and leads to redundancy.   

Independent Relationships: The table mixes several independent relationships (e.g., student-to-assignment grades, professor-to-assignments, assignments-to-relevant readings) in one table. In a properly normalized structure (to achieve 4NF), these should be separated into different tables to ensure that each table represents one and only one relationship.   

Composite Key Overuse: The original form relies on a presumed composite key (assignment_id, student_id, due_date) to uniquely identify rows, but this composite key doesn't effectively address the multi-valued dependencies present in the table. Proper normalization would require breaking down the table into parts where each key has a single, clear purpose.    

## Convert to 4NF
Fourth Normal Form (4NF) is concerned with multi-valued dependencies. A table is in 4NF if it is in 3NF and has no multi-valued dependencies, except for a possible composite primary key. This means each table should represent one and only one kind of relationship.
